## I. Detailed Study Guide

### 1. JavaScript Execution Context & Call Stack
* **Execution Context (EC)**: The environment where JavaScript code is executed.
    * **Components**:
        * *Memory Component (Variable Environment)*: Stores variables and functions as key-value pairs.
        * *Code Component (Thread of Execution)*: Executes code line by line.
    * **Phases**:
        * *Memory Creation Phase*: JavaScript scans the code, allocates memory to all variables (initialised with `undefined`) and functions (stores the entire function code).
        * *Code Execution Phase*: JavaScript executes the code line by line, assigning actual values to variables and executing function calls.
* **Call Stack**: A mechanism to manage the order of execution contexts.
    * **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)**: The most recently created EC is pushed onto the stack, and the completed EC is popped off.
    * **Global Execution Context (GEC)**: The base EC, always at the bottom of the stack when a JavaScript program starts.
    * **Function Execution Context**: A new EC created whenever a function is invoked, pushed onto the stack above the current EC.
    * **Blocking Behaviour**: JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language. This means only one operation can be executed at a time. Long-running synchronous tasks block the call stack, preventing other code from executing.
    * **Aliases**: Also known as the Execution Context Stack, Program Stack, Control Stack, Runtime Stack, or Machine Stack.

### 2. Hoisting
* **Definition**: A JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the memory creation phase, before the code is executed.
* **`var` vs. `let`/`const`**:
    * **`var` declarations**: Are hoisted and initialised with `undefined`. You can access them before their declaration without an error.
    * **`function` declarations**: Are hoisted, and the entire function code is stored in memory. You can invoke them before their declaration.
    * **`let`/`const` declarations**: Are also hoisted but are placed in a "Temporal Dead Zone" (TDZ). They are not initialised with `undefined`. Attempting to access them before their declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.
    * **Arrow Functions**: When assigned to `var`, `let`, or `const`, they behave like variables (hoisted with `undefined` for `var`, or in TDZ for `let`/`const`), not like traditional function declarations.

### 3. `undefined` vs. `not defined`
* **`undefined`**:
    * A special value assigned to variables during the memory creation phase if no explicit value is given.
    * Indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
    * `undefined` is a placeholder, taking up memory.
* **`not defined`**:
    * A `ReferenceError` thrown when trying to access a variable that has not been declared or allocated memory in the current scope.
    * Indicates that JavaScript cannot find the variable in any accessible memory space.

### 4. `window` Object & `this` Keyword
* **`window` Object (in browsers)**:
    * A global object automatically created with the Global Execution Context.
    * It contains all global variables, functions, and Web APIs (e.g., `setTimeout`, `localStorage`, `console`).
    * Provides a "window" through which JavaScript code can access browser functionalities.
* **`this` Keyword**:
    * At the global level (outside any function), `this` points to the global object (`window` in browsers).
    * Its value changes based on how a function is called (dynamic scoping).

### 5. Scope, Lexical Environment & Scope Chain
* **Scope**: Determines where variables and functions are accessible in the code.
* **Lexical Environment**:
    * A local memory component where variables and functions are stored.
    * Also contains a reference to its "parent" (or outer) lexical environment.
    * Created every time an Execution Context is created.
* **Lexical Scoping**: JavaScript uses lexical scoping, meaning the scope of a variable is determined by its physical placement in the code (where it's written).
* **Scope Chain**:
    * The chain of lexical environments, from the current (inner) scope to the global (outermost) scope.
    * When JavaScript tries to find a variable, it first looks in the current lexical environment. If not found, it traverses up the scope chain to the parent's lexical environment, and so on, until it reaches the global scope.
    * If the variable is not found anywhere in the scope chain, a `ReferenceError` ("not defined") is thrown.

### 6. Block Scope, Shadowing, & `var`/`let`/`const`
* **Block**: Defined by curly braces `{}`. Used to group multiple JavaScript statements into a single unit. Also known as a "compound statement."
* **Block Scope**: Variables declared with `let` and `const` inside a block are "block-scoped," meaning they are only accessible within that block.
* **`var` vs. `let`/`const` (Scope differences)**:
    * `var`: Function-scoped (or global if declared outside a function). Not block-scoped.
    * `let`/`const`: Block-scoped.
* **Shadowing**:
    * When a variable declared in an inner scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope. The inner variable "shadows" the outer one within its block.
    * `var` variables can be redeclared and updated within the same function scope, potentially leading to unintended shadowing if not careful.
    * `let` and `const` variables cannot be redeclared in the same scope, preventing certain types of accidental shadowing and making code more predictable.
    * `let` can shadow `var` and `let` in a nested block. `const` can shadow `var` and `let` in a nested block. `var` cannot shadow `let` or `const` in a nested block if the `let`/`const` is in a higher lexical scope.

### 7. First-Class Functions
* **Definition**: The ability of functions to be treated as values.
* **Characteristics**:
    * Can be assigned to variables (Function Expressions).
    * Can be passed as arguments to other functions (Callbacks/Higher-Order Functions).
    * Can be returned from other functions (Closures).
* **First-Class Citizens**: Functions in JavaScript are often called "first-class citizens" due to these capabilities.
* **Anonymous Functions**: Functions without a name. Cannot be used as function statements; must be used as values (e.g., in function expressions or as callbacks).

### 8. Callback Functions & Event Listeners
* **Callback Function**: A function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed later (i.e., "called back").
* **Event Listeners**: A common use case for callbacks.
    * Allow JavaScript to react to events (e.g., clicks, key presses).
    * When an event occurs, the registered callback function is executed.
* **Asynchronous Operations**: Callbacks are crucial for handling asynchronous operations, enabling non-blocking code execution in a single-threaded environment.

### 9. Closures
* **Definition**: A closure is a function bundled together with its lexical environment.
    * This means a function, when returned from another function, still "remembers" and can access the variables from its parent's scope (even after the parent function's execution context has popped off the call stack).
* **Key Concept**: The inner function maintains a reference to the outer function's variables, not just their values at the time of creation.
* **Use Cases**:
    * **Data Privacy/Encapsulation**: Creating private variables that can only be accessed or modified through specific functions. (e.g., counter functions that manage their own internal state).
    * **Memoization**: Caching function results.
    * **Currying**: Transforming functions.
    * **Module Design Pattern**: Structuring code into reusable modules.
    * **`setTimeout` in Loops**: A classic interview problem where closures are essential to capture the correct value of a loop variable (`var`) at each iteration.
* **Garbage Collection and Closures**: JavaScript's garbage collector frees up memory that is no longer referenced. However, if a closure is holding a reference to an outer scope variable, that variable will not be garbage collected until the closure itself is no longer referenced, potentially leading to memory leaks if not managed carefully.

### 10. `setTimeout` and Asynchronous JavaScript
* **Asynchronous Nature**: `setTimeout` registers a callback function to be executed after a specified delay. It does not block the main call stack.
* **Web APIs**: `setTimeout` is a Web API (provided by the browser environment), not part of the JavaScript engine itself.
* **Event Loop, Callback Queue, Microtask Queue**:
    * **Web APIs**: Browser functionalities (like `setTimeout`, DOM APIs, `fetch`) that execute in the background.
    * **Callback Queue (Task Queue)**: Stores callback functions from Web APIs (e.g., `setTimeout`, DOM Event Listeners) that are ready to be executed.
    * **Microtask Queue**: Stores callback functions from promises (e.g., `.then()`, `.catch()`, `.finally()`) and Mutation Observers.
    * **Event Loop**: Continuously monitors the Call Stack and the Callback/Microtask Queues. Its only job is to push functions from the queues to the Call Stack only when the Call Stack is empty.
    * **Priority**: Microtask Queue has higher priority than the Callback Queue. Functions in the Microtask Queue are executed before functions in the Callback Queue when the Call Stack is empty.
* **"Trust Issues" with `setTimeout`**: The delay specified in `setTimeout` is a minimum delay, not a guaranteed execution time. If the Call Stack is busy with long-running synchronous code, the `setTimeout` callback will have to wait in the Callback Queue until the Call Stack is clear, even if its timer has expired. This can lead to delays longer than the specified time.

### 11. Higher-Order Functions, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
* **Higher-Order Function (HOF)**: A function that either:
    * Takes one or more functions as arguments (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `reduce`).
    * Returns a function.
* **Functional Programming**: HOFs are fundamental to functional programming, promoting modular, reusable, and readable code.
* **`map()`**:
    * **Purpose**: Transforms each element in an array and returns a new array containing the transformed elements.
    * **Syntax**: `array.map(callbackFunction)`
    * **Callback**: Applied to each element, returning the new value for that element.
* **`filter()`**:
    * **Purpose**: Filters elements from an array based on a condition and returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.
    * **Syntax**: `array.filter(callbackFunction)`
    * **Callback**: Applied to each element, returning `true` to keep the element or `false` to discard it.
* **`reduce()`**:
    * **Purpose**: Iterates over an array and "reduces" all its elements to a single value.
    * **Syntax**: `array.reduce(callbackFunction, initialValue)`
    * **Callback**: Takes an accumulator (the accumulated result) and currentValue (the current element). Returns the updated accumulator.
    * **`initialValue` (optional)**: The starting value for the accumulator. If not provided, the first element of the array is used as the `initialValue` and the iteration starts from the second element.
    * **Use Cases**: Calculating sums, finding maximums, grouping data, etc.
* **Chaining**: `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` can be chained together to perform complex transformations and aggregations in a concise and readable way.

### 12. JavaScript Engine (Google's V8 Architecture)
* **Runtime Environment**: JavaScript code needs a runtime environment to execute (e.g., browser, Node.js). This environment provides Web APIs, Event Loop, Microtask Queue, Callback Queue, etc., in addition to the JavaScript engine.
* **JavaScript Engine (e.g., V8)**: A program that takes JavaScript code and executes it.
    * **Components**:
        * **Parser**: Takes the raw JavaScript code and converts it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST is a tree-like representation of the code's structure.
        * **Interpreter (Ignition in V8)**: Takes the AST and converts it into bytecode. Executes the bytecode line by line.
        * **Compiler (TurboFan in V8)**: An optimising compiler that works alongside the interpreter. It takes frequently executed (hot) bytecode and compiles it into highly optimised machine code for faster execution.
        * **Memory Heap**: Where memory for variables and objects is allocated.
        * **Call Stack**: Manages the execution contexts.
        * **Garbage Collector (Orinoco in V8)**: Automatically reclaims memory that is no longer being used by the program.
* **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: Modern JavaScript engines use a combination of an interpreter and a compiler. The interpreter quickly starts executing the code, and the compiler optimises the "hot" parts of the code for performance, balancing quick startup with high-performance execution.
* **Optimisation Techniques**: Engines employ various techniques like inlining and copy elision to make JavaScript code run faster.

## II. Quiz (Short Answer Questions)

1.  **Explain the two phases of JavaScript's Execution Context creation.**
    > The first phase is the **Memory Creation Phase**, where JavaScript scans the code and allocates memory to all variables (initialised to `undefined`) and functions (stores the entire function code). The second phase is the **Code Execution Phase**, where JavaScript executes the code line by line, assigning actual values to variables and executing function calls.
2.  **What is the core difference in hoisting behaviour between `var` and `let` declarations?**
    > `var` declarations are hoisted and initialised with `undefined`, allowing access before declaration (though it will be `undefined`). `let` declarations are also hoisted but placed in the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**; attempting to access them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.
3.  **Define "closure" in JavaScript and provide one common use case.**
    > A **closure** is a function bundled with its lexical environment, meaning it "remembers" and can access variables from its outer scope even after that outer function has finished executing. A common use case is **data privacy**, where inner functions can access and modify private variables from an outer scope.
4.  **How does the Event Loop ensure non-blocking execution in single-threaded JavaScript?**
    > The **Event Loop** continuously monitors the Call Stack and the Callback/Microtask Queues. When the Call Stack is empty, it picks up the first ready callback from the Microtask Queue (if any) or then the Callback Queue and pushes it onto the Call Stack for execution, ensuring that long-running operations don't block the main thread indefinitely.
5.  **What is a Higher-Order Function, and which of `map`, `filter`, `reduce` are examples of HOFs?**
    > A **Higher-Order Function** is a function that either takes another function as an argument or returns a function. `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are all examples of Higher-Order Functions because they take a callback function as an argument.
6.  **When would you typically use `map()` over `filter()`?**
    > You would typically use `map()` when you need to **transform** each element of an array into a new value and produce a new array of these transformed values (e.g., doubling numbers, extracting full names). You would use `filter()` when you need to **select a subset** of elements from an array based on a specific condition.
7.  **Explain the "trust issues" associated with `setTimeout()`.**
    > The "trust issues" with `setTimeout()` refer to the fact that the delay specified (e.g., 500ms) is a **minimum delay**, not a guaranteed execution time. If the JavaScript Call Stack is busy with other synchronous code when the timer expires, the `setTimeout` callback will have to wait in the Callback Queue until the Call Stack becomes empty, leading to a longer actual delay.
8.  **What is the purpose of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in a JavaScript engine?**
    > The Parser component of a JavaScript engine takes the raw JavaScript code and converts it into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**. The AST is a tree-like, hierarchical representation of the code's structure, making it easier for the interpreter and compiler to understand and process the code.
9.  **Differentiate between "undefined" and "not defined" in JavaScript.**
    > **`undefined`** is a special value assigned to a declared variable that hasn't been assigned an explicit value yet. It means memory has been allocated. **`not defined`** is a `ReferenceError` indicating that a variable was never declared in the current or any accessible scope, meaning no memory was allocated for it.
10. **Describe the concept of "shadowing" in the context of block scope.**
    > **Shadowing** occurs when a variable declared in an inner (e.g., block) scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope. The inner variable "shadows" the outer one, meaning within the inner block, the inner variable's value takes precedence, while the outer variable remains unaffected outside that block.

## IV. Glossary of Key Terms

* **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: A tree-like representation of the syntactic structure of source code, created by the parser, used by the JavaScript engine for further processing.

* **Anonymous Function**: A function without a name. They are typically used as function expressions or callback functions.
* **Asynchronous**: Operations that do not block the execution of the main program. In JavaScript, these are often handled using Web APIs, callbacks, Promises, and the Event Loop.
* **Block**: A group of zero or more statements enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Used for control flow (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`) and to define block scope.
* **Block Scope**: The scope created by a block `{}`. Variables declared with `let` and `const` inside a block are only accessible within that block.
* **Callback Function**: A function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
* **Callback Queue (Task Queue)**: A queue in the browser environment (outside the JavaScript engine) where callback functions (e.g., from `setTimeout`, DOM events) are placed once their asynchronous operation is complete, waiting for the Event Loop to move them to the Call Stack.
* **Call Stack**: A LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) stack that manages the execution of functions. When a function is called, its execution context is pushed onto the stack; when it returns, it's popped off.
* **Closure**: A function that "remembers" its lexical environment (variables from its outer scope) even after the outer function has finished executing.
* **Code Component (Thread of Execution)**: The part of an Execution Context where JavaScript code is executed line by line. JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning only one instruction can be executed at a time.
